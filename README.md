Teleporter for iOS.

This is a project of mine that has gone out of development. It was a GPS spoofer app that ran on jailbroken iOS8 phones. Unlike other spoofers at the time, the application queried an online API to determine the appropriate elevation for the user to have when they wanted to spoof to a specific location. This was meant to circumvent simple spoofing detection methods based on elevation mismatch that other applications may have attempted to use.

iTeleport was developed on Windows and theOS using Putty to interface between the Windows machine and my iPhone.
